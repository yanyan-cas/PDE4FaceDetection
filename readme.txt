The code is for the paper "Feature Learning via Partial Differential Equation with Applications to Face Recognition" 
by Cong Fang, Zhenyu Zhao, Pan Zhou, and Zhouchen Lin
published on Pattern Recognition.

******************************************************************************************************************
The code is tested on Windows 7 with MATLAB R2013b.
******************************************************************************************************************
Usage:
>run 'test.m'
On the Extended Yale B dataset with 10 (20) training samples for each class, you will obtain the accuracy with around 96.5% (99.0%).

When I settle the code, I find that this code might have done some variants on the original one that is described in the paper. Because after we have submitted our paper, we have tried to further improve our method.
